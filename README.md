1.1 PROJECT DETAILS
The AI-Powered Text-to-Video Generator is an automated system that transforms text
input into professional-quality videos. Designed for content creators, marketers, and
educators, this tool eliminates the need for manual video editing by leveraging
artificial intelligence to generate scripts, voiceovers, captions, and visuals. Key Features
 AI-Generated Scripts – Converts topics into engaging narratives using Groq/OpenAI.  Natural Voiceovers – Edge TTS produces lifelike speech in multiple accents.  Automated Captions – Whisper Timestamped generates time-synced subtitles.  Smart Visuals – Pexels API fetches relevant stock footage.  Seamless Rendering – MoviePy combines all elements into a polished video. 1.2 PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to create an automated video generation system that
transforms user-provided topics into engaging short videos, suitable for platforms like
YouTube Shorts. The system integrates AI-driven script generation, text-to-speech
conversion, timed captioning, and dynamic background video selection to produce
high-quality, fact-based content. 1.3 OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to automate the creation of short, engaging, and visually appealing videos from a given text topic, streamlining content production
for platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels. Key Goals:
Automated Script Generation
Use AI models (GPT-4 or Groq) to generate concise, fact-based scripts optimized for
short-form video content.
